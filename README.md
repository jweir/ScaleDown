[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jweir/ScaleDown.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jweir/ScaleDown)

The image scaling server used by [Fame Driver](http://famedriver.com).
It supports dynamic sizes, image cropping and color conversion (CMYK to RGB).
It only supports images on the same machine (this is not a distributed scaler).

ScaleDown
==========
So you want to scale an image?
------------------------------

You have an image on `example.com`. It has a public path of
`/images/john/picture.png`.  You want it scaled to fit in a 400x400 pixel box.
ScaleDown is running on the subdomain `images`.

    http://server/images/john/scaled/400x400/picture.png?HMAC_SIGNATURE

The scaled file is saved in a public path identical to the request. It will be
statically served on the next request.

Geometry, Labels and Cropping
==============================

There are two methods of requesting a scaled image: label or geometry.

Labels
------

A label is a predefined box the scaled image will fit within.
Labels are defined in the `config.ru` file.

```sh
# A label called thumbnail has been defined as "100x100"
# The below url will scale picture.png to fit into a 100 x 100 box
http://server/images/john/scaled/thumbnail/picture.png
                          ^^^^^^
```

```ruby
# in your config.ru file
  config.labels = {
    "thumbnail" => "100x100"
  }
```

Geometry
--------

Geometries allow the client to request an image of any size.

A geometry defines a box the image must fit within: `WIDTHxHEIGHT`.


```sh
# scale to a 300 pixel width box by 900 pixel high box
http://server/images/john/scaled/300x900/picture.png?HMAC_SIGNATURE
^^^^^^^
```

Either, but not both, dimensions may use the keyword `auto`. This will scale
the image to fit the defined dimension.

```sh
# scale to a 500 pixel wide box, of any height
http://server/images/john/scaled/500xauto/picture.png?HMAC_SIGNATURE
                                     ^^^^
```

When using a geometry an HMAC is required (see below).
    
Crop
----

To crop an image include the `-crop` option.  The image will be scaled and
cropped to fit the geometry. This is a simple crop positioned on the center and
top of the image.

Both geometry and labels accept the `-crop` option.

```sh
http://server/images/john/scaled/thumbnail-crop/picture.png
http://server/images/john/scaled/100x100-crop/picture.png
```

Info
----
There is a simple `/info` function for getting image dimensions. It just
returns a json response the width, height and additional details of the
original file.

HMAC & Geometry
==============

An HMAC signature is required to prevent a DOS attack. This ensures that your URL was generated by a trusted source.

HMAC requires a shared key between the application generating the URL and the ScaleDown server.

Ruby HMAC URL Generator
------------------

```ruby
require 'ruby-hmac'

def signed_image_url(absolute_path, filename, geometry)
  shared_secret = "secret"
  hmac = HMAC::SHA1.new(shared_secret).update([absolute_path, 'scaled', geometry, filename].join("/")).to_s[0...8]
  "http://server#{[absolute_path, 'scaled', geometry, CGI.escape(filename)].join("/")}?#{hmac}"
end
```

Node.js HMAC URL Generator
---------------------

```javascript
// Uses the Node.js crypot library
var crypto = require('crypto')

function hmac(string){
  var shared_secret = "secret"
  return crypto.createHmac('sha1',shared_secret).update(string).digest('hex').substr(0,8)
}

function signed_image_url(absolute_path, filename, geometry){
  signature = hmac( [ absolute_path, '/scaled', "/" + geometry, "/", filename].join("") )
  return [global.$FD.assetHost,  absolute_path, '/scaled', "/", geometry, "/",escape(filename)].join("") + "?"+ signature
}
```

URL Schema
==========

The schema is

    http://:host/:path_to_file/scaled/:target/:filename?:hmac_signature

    :host           the address running ScaleDown
    :path_to_file   the public path of the original file
    `scaled`        keyword
    :target         a label or width x height. An optional `-crop` can be included with either
    :filename       the filename of the original image to scale
    :hmac_signature security measure to validate the request(not required for labels)


Supported Image Formats
=======================

ScaleDown will handle any image that Image Magick can process.  But there are some rules:

* PNGs remain PNGs
* All other images are converted to JPG and issued a 301 redirect

Installation & Configuration
==============================

    gem install scale_down

Create a Rackup file (config.ru). 

See https://github.com/jweir/ScaleDown/tree/master/config.sample.ru for all options

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'scale_down'

ScaleDown.tap do |config|
  # Shared secret for generating the HMAC signature
  config.hmac_key    = "secret"

  # Path to the public directory
  config.public_folder = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))+"/public"
end

run ScaleDown::Controller
```

Configure Nginx, Apache, etc to run the server.

Known Issues
===========

Pluses in filenames will not route properly.  Filenames need to have these removed or replaced.

Dependencies
============

* Sinatra
* RMagick
* Ruby-HMAC

RMagick can be a bit tricky to install, these links
http://www.google.com/search?q=install+rmagick might help.
